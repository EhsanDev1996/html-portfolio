<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a passionate and self-motivated learner with a strong interest in web development and programming. I enjoy building real-world projects that solve problems and help me grow as a developer. My journey began with curiosity and has turned into a focused path toward becoming a skilled web developer.</p>

<p>I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript deeply, and expanding my knowledge through hands-on practice and personal projects. I believe in learning by doing — breaking things, fixing them, and learning along the way.</p>

<p>I’m working towards mastering front-end and back-end development, with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer and building beautiful, functional, and user-friendly web applications. I’m also exploring the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) as part of my growth.</p>

<p>Whether it’s learning something new, solving problems, or collaborating on meaningful projects, I’m always excited to improve and grow in this field.</p>
